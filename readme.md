Multiplayer MIDI jam space for digital fusion music performers and producers. Users connect with their MIDI instruments and everyone can play music together remotely, simulating a physical jam session. Thanks https://www.openode.io/ for hosting.

Some notes:

- Nothing is stored on the server, period. Only 1 hour of chat log history is ever preserved; after that it vanishes into the void.
- Setting reverb to 0 disconnects it entirely, saving a bit of CPU
- Muting the audio also disconnects everything (TRUE BYPASS RITE?), again saving CPU
- Pitch bend does not work on sampled instruments.
- Sampled instruments also do not support loop points so they don't sustain very long.
- For synth instruments, click on a parameter value to be able to type it in. Hit "enter" to make sure it updates.
- ADSR parameters don't automate well; they don't take effect until the next note on.
- Sustain pedal supported.
- Synth patches can be exported & imported via the clipboard.
- If you are idle on your instrument for a while, it becomes available for others to take. Longer and it gets automatically released.
